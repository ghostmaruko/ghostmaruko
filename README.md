# 👋 Hi, I'm Marco Esu  

## Junior Software Engineer | Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Developer

👨‍💻 **About Me**  

Junior Software Engineer with a background in Interior & Graphic Design (IED), combining strong visual/UX sensitivity with solid software engineering fundamentals.

I design and build responsive, user-centered web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks and RESTful architectures. My approach emphasizes clean architecture, maintainable code, performance, and secure backend integration.

With experience in both development and software testing, I bring a quality-oriented mindset to every project — from UI implementation to API validation and automated testing.

Currently focused on growing as a full-stack developer, with a specialization in frontend engineering and scalable web applications.
